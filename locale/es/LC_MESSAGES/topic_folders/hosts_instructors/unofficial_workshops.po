"An official Carpentries workshop must cover the core lessons for that "
"lesson program's curriculum.  Read more about the Software Carpentry, "
"Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry lessons.  The workshop must also be"
" taught by at least one certified Carpentries Instructor.  While "
"Instructors do receive lesson program specific badges, The Carpentries "
"considers any badged Instructor qualified to teach any lesson."

"All our lessons are availalbe under a Creative Commons license, so anyone"
" is welcome to use our lessons as they wish, provided they attribute them"
" back to us.  We often get questions about running un-official "
"Carpentries workshops -- meaning they are taught by non-certfied "
"instructors, or they cover a portion of our curriculum but not the whole "
"thing. We are excited to hear when this happens, but it is not something "
"we are formally tracking."

"We know this happens because our community members recognize the value of"
" our curricula and have taken the initiative to adapt it to other "
"contexts, where a two day workshop covering our full lesson set may not "
"be the best fit. This demonstrates a lot of effort by the instructors and"
" organizers. Also, while the impact on the learners is different than "
"what we'd expect from a full workshop, there is still something "
"significant that learners are taking away from this event.  We may "
"consider exploring ways to track these non-standard workshops (both to "
"acknowledge the effort instructors put in and the impact it has on "
"learners), but we don't currently have the capacity to commit to this. So"
" please continue doing all the wonderful work you do - and we hope we can"
" reflect on this more soon!"
