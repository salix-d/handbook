"The Carpentries is usually not involved in travel arrangements for "
"workshops. Instead, once instructors have been selected, they negotiate "
"travel and accommodation with the workshop's host, and are then "
"reimbursed directly by the host. In order to consistently provide high-"
"quality workshops, however, the Carpentries must ensure that instructors "
"fulfill their commitments. In particular, it must do what it can to "
"ensure that instructors show up for workshops they have agreed to teach, "
"so that hosts have the appropriate number of instructors and do not incur"
" unnecessary expenses."

"Instructors who find that they will not be able to meet an agreed upon "
"teaching engagement are required to notify The Carpentries workshop "
"coordinator as soon as possible. If travel arrangement have not been "
"made, and the workshop is at least 6 weeks away, instructors may cancel "
"with no questions asked. If non-refundable travel has been booked or it "
"is less than 6 weeks from the workshop, instructors should clearly "
"communicate the reason for missing their teaching engagement. The "
"workshop coordinator will then handle communication with the host and "
"attempt to find an alternate instructor if possible."

"Depending on their reason for missing their agreed upon teaching "
"engagement, instructors may be required to reimburse any non-refundable "
"travel or accommodation costs that the host may already have incurred on "
"their behalf. The Carpentries may waive this requirement in special "
"circumstances outlined below, based on the judgement of The Carpentries "
"Policy Subcommittee."

"In some cases, the Carpentries will waive the requirement for the "
"instructor to reimburse the host, and the Carpentries will reimburse the "
"host for any expenses incurred. Circumstances in which the Carpentries "
"will reimburse the host for any expenses incurred for missed workshops "
"include, but are not limited to: illness, injury, family or work related "
"emergencies, weather or transportation malfunction. Instructors may be "
"required to provide appropriate documentation to the Policy Subcommittee."
" If an instructor is required to reimburse costs, but refuses to do so, "
"or an instructor fails to provide adequate notice of withdrawal more than"
" once, the Carpentries reserve the right to suspend their Carpentries "
"instructor status."
