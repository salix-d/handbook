"Assessment plays a key role in ensuring the success, longevity, and "
"evolution of the Carpentries workshops. The primary goal of our "
"assessment efforts is to evaluate the impact we are having teaching data "
"skills throughout our global community. Our assessment efforts are meant "
"to guide the development, implementation, and instruction of our "
"workshops. We are committed to providing directed feedback to our "
"community regarding our assessment targets and using information "
"collected from assessment to improve how we teach data skills and build "
"learning communities."

"Our assessment tools will cover content knowledge, self-efficacy, and "
"metacognitive strategies. Additionally, evaluation will occur at the end "
"of each workshop and 6 months after a workshop with data releases "
"published bi-annually, and an annual review of our impact will be "
"published on our website.  Source code, data, and additional information "
"are also available in this GitHub repository."

"We assess our learners by measuring changes in their attitudes, "
