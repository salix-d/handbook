"Many Instructors add to the number of lessons they feel comfortable "

"to apply, it would be useful to have attended a Carpentries workshop "
"either as a learner or helper and have some familiarly with at least one "
"of the topics. That way, you will know more about what being an "
"Instructor involves, and you can assess whether the workshop style and "
"teaching method are for you. Having already participated in a workshop "
"will be a plus on our scoring rubric if you decide to apply."
