"The first Carpentries workshops in Africa were run in 2013 but it only "
"really kicked off in 2015. An African Task Force was established in 2016,"
" consisting of international mentors from the USA, UK, and Australia, and"
" guided the first batch of trained African instructors through the "
"checkout process as most of them were very isolated and new to the world "
"of the Carpentries."

"Since then more than 100 African instructors have participated in online "
"or in-person instructor training events. The African Task Force was "
"revived in December 2017, then completely consisting of African "
"instructors. The task force played a role in mentoring instructors who "
"had been trained but hadn’t qualified as well as qualified instructors "
"who needed support before teaching a workshop. Small online sessions were"
" hosted by task force members to demonstrate how various lessons are "
"taught and to help solidify skills in the tools we teach. The second "
"African Task Force finished its activities in December 2018. Some of the "
"South African-based activities were funded through the Rural Campuses "
"Connection Project II (RCCP II), which ended in March 2019. You can read "
"more about the experiences of the African Task Force in this blog post "
"and about RCCPII here."
