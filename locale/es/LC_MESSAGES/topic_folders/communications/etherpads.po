"While etherpads are generally reliable, you may find an etherpad not "
"loading as expected.  In this case, you can try appending /export/html to"
" an etherpad's url.  For example, if "
"https://pad.carpentries.org/committeename is not loading, it may be "
"possible to recover its text by going to "
"https://pad.carpentries.org/committeename/export/html. This text content "
"can then be copied and pasted to a new etherpad. Note this will not "
"preserve the etherpad's history.  The chat will often still be active in "
"the broken etherpad, so it is recommended that you link to the new "
"etherpad in the broken etherpad's chat."
